## 🔍 Test Highlights

### Most Critical Test:
**Integration Test #1**: "Complete flow: Anonymous → Sign In → Dashboard"
- Tests entire user journey
- 10 verification points
- Covers 5 phases:
  1. Anonymous submission
  2. OAuth sign-in
  3. Authenticated access
  4. Dashboard view
  5. Cross-device access

### Most Complex Test:
**Integration Test #7**: "Real-world scenario: User workflow over 1 week"
- Simulates multi-day user behavior
- Tests token persistence
- Verifies migration of multiple submissions
- Validates cross-device access

### Edge Cases Covered:
- ✅ Empty tokens/userIds
- ✅ Invalid tokens
- ✅ Case-sensitive userIds
- ✅ Multiple migrations (idempotency)
- ✅ Zero compensation values
- ✅ NULL levels
- ✅ Different tokenHashes
- ✅ Already-linked submissions

## 🧪 Test Data Structure

### Typical Test Setup:
```typescript
// Seeded data from tests/setup.ts
testData = {
  industries: { tech, finance },
  companies: { google, meta },
  jobTitles: { swe: "Software Engineer", data: "Data Scientist" },
  locations: { sf: "San Francisco, CA", ny: "New York, NY" },
  levels: { l3: "L3", l4: "L4" }
}

// Form data used in most tests
validFormData = {
  companyId: google,
  jobTitleId: swe,
  locationId: sf,
  baseSalary: 150000,
  bonus: 20000,
  stock: 400000 (vested over 4 years = 100k/year),
  yearsOfExperience: 5,
  ...
}

// Expected total compensation
150k + 20k + 100k = 270k
```

## 🐛 Test Failure Debugging

### If "Token Migration" tests fail:
1. Check `ANONYMOUS_TOKEN_SALT` is set in `.env.test`
2. Verify database schema has `user_token_hash` column
3. Check `salarySubmission` table has index on `user_token_hash`
4. Verify migration 0004 was applied

### If "Access Control" tests fail:
1. Check `checkUserHasAccess` function signature (2 parameters)
2. Verify uses `or()` from drizzle-orm
3. Check SalaryResultsList passes both token and userId
4. Verify database queries use correct conditions

### If "Get Submissions" tests fail:
1. Check JOINs are correct (leftJoin for nullable fields)
2. Verify foreign keys exist
3. Check location formatting (city, state, country)
4. Verify compensation calculation (base + bonus + stock)

### If "Integration" tests fail:
1. Run individual suite tests first to isolate issue
2. Check test database is clean between tests
3. Verify `beforeEach` runs successfully
4. Check timing issues (use `await` for all async calls)

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

Based on test execution times:

| Suite | Expected Time | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Token Migration | ~8-12 seconds | 12 tests with DB operations |
| Access Control | ~10-15 seconds | 16 tests with queries |
| Get Submissions | ~12-18 seconds | 17 tests with JOINs |
| Integration | ~15-25 seconds | 8 comprehensive tests |
| **Total** | **~45-70 seconds** | All 53 tests |

**Optimization**: Tests run in parallel within each suite.

## 🔐 Security Test Coverage

### Token Security:
- ✅ Tokens never stored in plaintext
- ✅ PBKDF2 hashing verified
- ✅ Salt usage confirmed
- ✅ Invalid tokens handled gracefully
- ✅ Token hash preserved after migration

### Access Control:
- ✅ No access without submission
- ✅ No access with wrong token
- ✅ No access with wrong userId
- ✅ Access correctly granted to authenticated users
- ✅ Cross-device access works via userId

### Data Integrity:
- ✅ Submissions linked to correct user
- ✅ Already-linked submissions not overwritten
- ✅ Multiple submissions migrate atomically
- ✅ Idempotent migrations (safe to run multiple times)

## 🎓 Learning from Tests

### Test Patterns Used:

1. **Arrange-Act-Assert** (AAA):
   ```typescript
   // Arrange
   const token = generateAnonymousToken()
   const userId = 'test-user'

   // Act
   await submitSalary(formData, token)
   await migrateAnonymousSubmissions(userId, token)

   // Assert
   const hasAccess = await checkUserHasAccess(undefined, userId)
   expect(hasAccess).toBe(true)
   ```

2. **Given-When-Then** (BDD style in integration tests):
   ```typescript
   // Given: User has anonymous submission
   // When: User signs in
   // Then: Submission is linked to account
   ```

3. **Test Helpers**:
   - `seedTestData()` - Fresh data for each test
   - `generateAnonymousToken()` - Create test tokens
   - `validFormData` - Reusable form object

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

Add to your CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):

```yaml
- name: Run OAuth Tests
  run: |
    export NODE_ENV=test
    npm test -- tests/actions/migrate
    npm test -- tests/actions/check-access-oauth
    npm test -- tests/actions/get-user-submissions
    npm test -- tests/integration/oauth-flow
  env:
    DATABASE_URL: ${{ secrets.TEST_DATABASE_URL }}
    ANONYMOUS_TOKEN_SALT: ${{ secrets.TEST_TOKEN_SALT }}
```

## 📝 Next Steps

### After Tests Pass:
1. ✅ Merge to main branch
2. ✅ Deploy to staging
3. ✅ Run tests against staging DB
4. ✅ Monitor migration success rate
5. ✅ Deploy to production

### Future Test Enhancements:
1. Add performance tests (measure migration time)
2. Add stress tests (1000+ submissions)
3. Add concurrency tests (simultaneous migrations)
4. Add UI component tests (Dashboard, AuthModal)
5. Add E2E tests with Playwright
