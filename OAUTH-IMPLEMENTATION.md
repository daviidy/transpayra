# OAuth Sign-In Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Phase 1: Supabase OAuth Configuration
**Status**: ✅ Completed by you
- GitHub OAuth configured in Supabase
- Google OAuth configured in Supabase

### Phase 2: Anonymous Token Migration ✨
**File**: `src/app/actions/migrate-anonymous-submissions.ts`

**Purpose**: Automatically link anonymous submissions to user account when they sign in

**How it works**:
1. User submits salary anonymously → Token generated + stored in cookie
2. User later signs in with GitHub/Google
3. System finds their anonymous token cookie
4. Hashes token and searches for matching submissions
5. Links all anonymous submissions to their authenticated user account

**Key Features**:
- Only migrates submissions that haven't been linked yet (`userId IS NULL`)
- Preserves anonymous submissions (doesn't delete tokenHash)
- Logs migration count for debugging

### Phase 3: Updated Auth Callback 🔄
**File**: `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts`

**Changes**:
- Import `migrateAnonymousSubmissions` action
- After successful OAuth sign-in:
  1. Check for `anonymous_user_token` cookie
  2. If found, call migration function
  3. Log migration results
  4. Redirect to `/dashboard` (instead of homepage)

**Flow**:
```
GitHub/Google OAuth → Exchange code for session → Migrate submissions → Dashboard
```

### Phase 4: Enhanced Access Control 🔐
**File**: `src/app/actions/check-access.ts`

**Changes**:
- Function now accepts **both** `anonymousToken` and `userId`
- Checks access via **either** condition (OR logic)
- Supports authenticated users, anonymous users, and hybrid states

**Benefits**:
- Anonymous users: Access via token hash (as before)
- Authenticated users: Access via userId (cross-device!)
- Migration period: Works with both methods simultaneously

**Updated in**: `src/components/search/SalaryResultsList.tsx`
- Now passes both `token` and `user.id` to `checkUserHasAccess`
- Uses `useAuth()` hook to get authenticated user

### Phase 5: User Dashboard 🎨
**File**: `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Design**: Apple-inspired (clean, minimal, card-based)

**Features**:

#### Left Sidebar:
- **Profile Section**:
  - Avatar with initials (gradient background)
  - Full name (from OAuth metadata)
  - Email address
- **Navigation**:
  - My Submissions (active by default)
  - Statistics
  - Browse Salaries
  - Add New Submission

#### Main Content - Submissions Tab:
- **Header**: Title + description
- **Empty State**: Friendly prompt to add first salary
- **Submission Cards**:
  - Job title + level badge
  - Company, location, experience, date
  - Total compensation (large, bold)
  - Breakdown: Base | Stock | Bonus
  - Hover effect with shadow

#### Main Content - Statistics Tab:
- **Total Submissions**: Count with icon
- **Average Compensation**: Calculated from all submissions
- **Account Type**: OAuth provider (GitHub/Google)
- **Member Since**: Account creation date

### Phase 6: Get User Submissions Action 📊
**File**: `src/app/actions/get-user-submissions.ts`

**Purpose**: Fetch all salary submissions for authenticated user

**Features**:
- Queries by `userId` (primary)
- Also includes pre-migration anonymous submissions via `tokenHash`
- JOINs with company, jobTitle, location, level tables
- Calculates total compensation
- Orders by submission date (newest first)
- Returns formatted location string

### Phase 7: UI Polish ✨
**File**: `src/components/navbar/Navbar.tsx`

**Change**: Added `cursor-pointer` class to "Register / Sign in" button

## 🎯 Complete User Flows

### Flow 1: Anonymous User → Sign In
```
1. User visits site → Anonymous token generated
2. User submits salary → Stored with tokenHash
3. User browses salaries → Has access (via token)
4. User clicks "Register / Sign in"
5. Chooses GitHub or Google
6. OAuth callback:
   - Creates session
   - Finds anonymous token cookie
   - Migrates submission to userId
7. Redirects to dashboard
8. User sees their submission in "My Submissions"
```

### Flow 2: New User → Sign In First
```
1. User visits site → Clicks "Register / Sign in"
2. Signs in with GitHub/Google
3. Redirects to dashboard (no submissions yet)
4. User clicks "Add New Submission"
5. Fills form → Submits
6. Submission saved with userId (not tokenHash)
7. User has access to all salary data
8. Can view submission in dashboard
```

### Flow 3: Existing Authenticated User
```
1. User returns to site → Supabase session active
2. Navbar shows User icon (not sign-in button)
3. Can access all salary data automatically
4. Clicks User icon → Goes to dashboard
5. Views submission history
6. Cross-device access (not cookie-dependent)
```

## 🔄 Migration Behavior

### Before Sign-In:
```sql
-- Anonymous submission
{
  submission_id: 1,
  user_id: NULL,
  user_token_hash: "abc123...",
  company_id: 5,
  ...
}
```

### After Sign-In:
```sql
-- Now linked to user
{
  submission_id: 1,
  user_id: "uuid-from-supabase",  ← UPDATED
  user_token_hash: "abc123...",   ← PRESERVED
  company_id: 5,
  ...
}
```

**Why preserve tokenHash?**
- Backward compatibility
- Allows checking both methods during transition
- No data loss if migration fails

## 🔐 Access Control Matrix

| User State | Token Cookie | User Session | Access Via | Cross-Device |
|------------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|
| Anonymous | ✅ Present | ❌ None | tokenHash | ❌ No |
| Just Signed In | ✅ Present | ✅ Active | userId OR tokenHash | ✅ Yes |
| Returning Auth | ⚠️ May expire | ✅ Active | userId | ✅ Yes |
| Cleared Cookies | ❌ None | ✅ Active | userId | ✅ Yes |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Test Anonymous Flow:
- [ ] Visit site (token generated)
- [ ] Submit salary anonymously
- [ ] Verify access to salary results
- [ ] Check cookie exists: `anonymous_user_token`

### Test Sign-In Migration:

- [ ] Click "Register / Sign in"
- [ ] Choose GitHub or Google
- [ ] After OAuth callback:
  - [ ] Check redirected to `/dashboard`
  - [ ] Check "My Submissions" shows the anonymous submission
  - [ ] Check console logs for migration message
  - [ ] Verify database: `user_id` now set, `user_token_hash` preserved

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Submissions not migrating"
**Check**:
1. Console logs in auth callback
2. Verify cookie exists: DevTools → Application → Cookies → `anonymous_user_token`
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM salary_submission WHERE user_token_hash = 'hash'`
4. Verify `ANONYMOUS_TOKEN_SALT` environment variable set

### "Dashboard shows no submissions"
**Check**:
1. User actually has submissions: `SELECT * FROM salary_submission WHERE user_id = 'uuid'`
2. Console for errors in `getUserSubmissions`
3. Verify JOINs work (foreign keys correct)

### "Access still denied after sign-in"
**Check**:
1. `checkUserHasAccess` receives `userId` parameter
2. `SalaryResultsList` passes `user?.id` from `useAuth()`
3. Database query uses OR condition correctly

## 📊 Database Schema Impact

### Before:
```sql
CREATE TABLE salary_submission (
  submission_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,                    -- Always NULL for anonymous
  user_token_hash TEXT,            -- Only way to track access
  ...
);
```

### After:
```sql
CREATE TABLE salary_submission (
  submission_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,                    -- NULL for anonymous, UUID for authenticated
  user_token_hash TEXT,            -- Preserved for backward compatibility
  ...
);

-- Access patterns:
-- Anonymous: WHERE user_token_hash = hash
-- Authenticated: WHERE user_id = uuid
-- Hybrid: WHERE user_id = uuid OR user_token_hash = hash
```

## 📈 Metrics to Track

Post-deployment, monitor:
- **Sign-up conversion rate**: Anonymous → Authenticated
- **Submission migration success**: % of migrations completed
- **Dashboard engagement**: Time spent, tabs viewed
- **Cross-device usage**: Same user, multiple IPs
- **OAuth provider split**: GitHub vs Google
